                Hi! I'm Steph Tipton. I like D&D, baking and gardening, horror podcasts, and pro wrestling. I have two cats named Bagel and Bento. This is my first ever web design class, and I'm looking forward to it. I hope it goes well! :)
            </p>
            <h2>Dungeons and Dragons</h2>
            <p>
                Dungeons and Dragons is a <strong>tabletop roleplaying game.</strong> It's usually played with 3-5 players. The <strong>Dungeon Master</strong> creates the story, and the players roll dice and roleplay to interact with it. I've been playing Dungeons and Dragons, or "D&D," since I was fourteen years old! I usually play elves and warlocks/sorcerers.  <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/how-to-play-dnd">Click here to learn more about D&D!</a> 
            </p>
            <h2>Gardening</h2>
            <p>
                One of the things I'm passionate about doing in my garden is planting <strong>pollinator-friendly plants.</strong> Pollinators are often threatened species or don't have enough resources, and these plants help support them! I get my seeds through Operation Pollination, which offers <strong>free</strong> packets of pollinator-friendly wildflower seeds. <a href="https://operationpollination.com/">Get them here!</a> 
            </p> 
            <h2>Horror Podcasts</h2> 
            <p>
                I started listening to podcasts when I started working behind the scenes in libraries--it can get very quiet! My favorite genre is horror, and there are some truly exciting horror podcasts out there. I recommend The Magnus Archives, its sequel The Magnus Protocol, Lore, and (if you're looking for some heartwarming with your horror) <a href="https://www.welcometonightvale.com/">Welcome to Night Vale.</a>
