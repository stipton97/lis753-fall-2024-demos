                Hi! I'm Steph Tipton. I like D&D, baking and gardening, horror podcasts, and pro wrestling. I have two cats named Bagel and Bento. This is my first ever web design class, and I'm looking forward to it. I hope it goes well! :)

            <h2>Dungeons and Dragons</h2>
            <p>
                Dungeons and Dragons is a <strong>tabletop roleplaying game.</strong> It's usually played with 3-5 players. The <strong>Dungeon Master</strong> creates the story, and the players roll dice and roleplay to interact with it. I've been playing Dungeons and Dragons, or D&D, since I was fourteen years old! I usually play elves and warlocks/sorcerers.  <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/how-to-play-dnd">Click here to learn more about D&D!</a>
